                    This theme gave me a basic understanding of and experience with how interaction between users and user interfaces works, as well as which theories, tools and methods I can use for research, design, testing and production of digital solutions for smartphones so that my work is based on specific insights about actual users instead of my own gut feelings and untenable assumptions.

                    The Design Sprint project was a very original one. Team creation was also very original. Firstly, we did a Basadur profile test and we have found out which creative problem solving (CPS) profile matches our personality (a generator, conceptualizer, optimizer or an inplementer). Then we were assigned to a group based on our results. We worked in accordance with the Design Sprint method which was developed at Google from a vision to grow UX culture and the practice of design leadership across the organization. We followed a 5-day guideline (Map-Sketch-Decide-Prototype-Test). The specific task we dealt with was making a prototype of a new "Fronter" - mobile only. Our client was KEA and we had some instructions which we had to have in mind while solving our task and we also had to follow the KEA Design Guide. We also documented our work process and progress.

                    <div id="project-subheadlines"><b>My reflections</b></div>
                    In my view, I think that this project was worthy of my time. However, it may seem a little bit prolonged and we could have invested more time into the different aspects of the project, but my overall feeling is the satisfaction. What I really appreciate is that we had really strict conditions and tasks which we had to follow, because it reminded me of a real company which received some requirements from a real client. So that gave us valuable experience in terms of our future careers. As far as group work goes, I think we faced some big challenges including illness and different opinions. Nevertheless, we could at least see why the role of a decider is so important.

                    The skills I gained during this project include some business models and techniques regarding the group work, user experience (we are designing for the users, not for ourselves) and a client - UX designer relationship.

                    This project is connected to the Design Sprint project (see on the top), developing it and implementing its solution into practice. I worked on my own and my task was to code a functional digital solution - Fronter platform (that we created in XD as a protoype). It had to be responsive website.I needed to document my work and my work process. I needed to be aware what code I am using because I had to explain it. At the end, I conducted and documented tests - a technical test and a user test.

                    <div id="project-subheadlines"><b>My reflections</b></div>
                    From my perspective, I can say it was not really demanding. Mostly because I had to do the whole project including documentation and another parts on my own. However, I gained some valuable skills and experience in individual work. I had to finish our prototype (create a responsive version) and make it into a "real" coded website. I learnt that I shouldn't take criticism personally, but look at it from the user point of view.

                    The skills I gained during this project covers coding of forms, including UI animation into my solution, conducting user tests and plan a future changes.
