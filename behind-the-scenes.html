                    It was a beautiful May night. I was in my bed. Sleeping. Dreaming. Suddenly, I woke up. I sat up and said: "I know what my portfolio website is going to look like."
                    <br>
                    No, of course not. I am just joking. To be honest, I precisely do not know when or how it started. But I know for sure, that I wanted to add some <b>background pictures of myself</b> the the website. So I asked my good friend <b>Aivars</b> to take some photos of me. He agreed, so we went to Christiania and did it. <b>I am thankful</b> for his time and editing and photography skills. Oh, by the way the yellow hoodie I didn't choose randomly. I wanted a <b>yellow color</b> to be a part of my portfolio.

                    <br>
                    Well, I had some <b>ideas</b> about the look of my website. But were they good? Were they solid? Were they worth my time? There were no other options than <b>draw it down</b>. Because the website has to be responsive, I needed to create <b>multiple wireframes</b> for multiple devices. So finally, I made the wireframes and <b>I have attached</b> two of them (one for a desktop and the second for the mobile) <b>next to this box</b>. I am sorry for you not seeing a masterpiece, but since they are sketches, I do not draw them half-an-hour (each), but I just put ideas on the paper. You can also see my notes as a part of the desktop wireframe.

                <div id="wait-wait-design-text">
                    <br>
                    As I mentioned before, the <b>choice of yellow color was not by accident</b>. Okay. And what about other colors? I wanted to keep it <b>minimalistic</b>, but at the same time, I wanted to <b>express myself and my personality</b>. So another two colors were definitely black and white (colors which do not change my idea of a minimalistic design). I did stick with these three colors but <b>one teacher</b> advised me to use <b>desaturated yellowish color</b> to add boxes around the text to adjust readability (because I had a different composition than I do have now). That is how my <b>box-layout scheme</b> was created! However, I needed to put everything together to see what my design will look like. So I created <b>a moodboard</b> and <b>a style tile</b> which can be seen <b>beneath</b> (note: they are clickable).

                    <br>
                    Of course, <b>I coded</b>. After design issues, I moved on to the actual coding. I started with the main page, the menu, background image etc. Something worked, something did not. I used (for the first time) <b>flexbox</b>, which was something completely new for me and I am very grateful for doing so. I appreciate learning <b>some new skills</b>. Even though I had an idea of the design, it was <b>changing</b>, <b>evolving</b> and I was <b>trying out</b> new things. Well, this is the process of development, what else could I have expected? I also included some <b>animations</b> (I hope, that you have discovered some of them - although I am sorry for you - using the mobiles because the animations were created mostly for the desktop user).

                    I can tell you - it wasn't. But it was <b>challenging</b> and <b>interesting</b>. The hardest part for me was <b>to start</b>! After starting to work on it, I was falling asleep in my bed thinking about this project, what I am going to do tomorrow and what I can include (and I am serious). And no, I am not a geek. Maybe a little bit a weirdo.
                    <br>
                    Anyway, if I did not know anything, <b>I searched it on the internet</b> or <b>asked for help</b> (thank you all). I also asked other people about their opinions and received some <b>feedback</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even though it was not easy, I really <b>enjoyed</b> the process of making <b>my portfolio</b>. I hope that the result has a value not only to me but also to you.
