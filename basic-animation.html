                    In this theme, my main aim was at understanding the concepts of basic animation, classic storytelling and character design as well as working with CSS animations and enhanced interactivity through JavaScript.

                    This project was divided into 3 smaller parts. The first part was aimed at creating a story (including logline, plot, characters, message, genre/mood and narrative curve) and a storyboard (drawn scenes with descriptions). Another part was about creating a style tile (choice of a style, making a colour palette, composition, ...) and a worksheet (drawn at least 2 characters in Illustrator, description of the main character and the main character with different expressions or in different positions). The last part was about creating <a id="projects-tasks-link" href="http://www.thenewpower.eu/KEA/animation/sprite-animation/" target="_blank">a sprite sheet animation</a>.

                    <div id="project-subheadlines"><b>My reflections</b></div>
                    In my opinion, it was a very interesting and challenging assignment. Especially, I loved the option of creating my own characters. However, it was a little bit limiting that we had to create in a specific style that we had to choose from the offered options. One of the biggest challenges for me was drawing my characters in Illustrator, making sprite sheet and making it work.

                    I have decided to connect these two projects together because they are 2 different assignments of one big project. The project I am talking about was a group project. We had to create a digital, interactive poster for one of the ten movies offered. The goal was to evoke interest in watching the movies within young adults and still stay true to the essence of the movie. Our group decided on and then create <a id="projects-tasks-link" href="CSS/Smaller-Projects/02_04_02_Group4.pdf" target="_blank">a moodboard, personas collage and a style tile</a> to the animation and <a id="projects-tasks-link" href="CSS/Smaller-Projects/Group4_Storyboard.pdf" target="_blank">a detailed storyboard</a>. Then we started to create an animation with some game-like user interactions, self-made sound effects/sound/speak. Then we conducted <a id="projects-tasks-link" href="CSS/Smaller-Projects/Summary_of_Peer_Review_Group4.pdf" target="_blank">peer reviews</a> and made changes. We try to make use of and follow animation rules. In the end, we had an interactive presentation.

                    <div id="project-subheadlines"><b>My reflections</b></div>
                    I am very thankful for the possibility to work on such a complex project in a group. I have learnt a lot, not only in the field of basic animation but also about social interactions and dealing with group work. From the professional aspect, I can say that I have gained knowledge of creating a GIF animation, creating and designing of a solution considering a specific target group, coding a complex animation using JavaScript and including sounds, what a personas collage is and how to create it and user testing. The biggest challenge for me was to understand how JavaScript works and to implement it into reality.
